# 🔮 신비한 운세 & AI 테스트 - Blueprint (Premium Plus-X Style)

## Overview

A high-end web application inspired by "Plus-X" design philosophy: Minimalist, Bold, and Interactive. Features unified fortune analysis and advanced social sharing capabilities (Image Save & Link).

## Design System (Inspired by Plus-X)

*   **Buttons:** Full-rounded pill shapes with sophisticated hover states and fluid motion.
*   **Typography:** Large, bold headlines with wide tracking and elegant sub-texts.
*   **Footer:** Minimalist copyright text positioned at the bottom-right.
*   **Aesthetics:** High-contrast minimalist color palette with premium indigo/purple accents.

## Key Functional Updates (Current Plan)

1.  **Unified Fortune Analysis:** Daily and Monthly fortunes are calculated simultaneously and displayed on one result page.
2.  **Visual Sharing:** 
    *   **Save as Image:** Captures the result card as a PNG using `html2canvas`.
    *   **Link Sharing:** Integrated sharing via Web Share API or Clipboard.
3.  **Animal Test Evolution:** 
    *   Split into `animal-test.html` (Input) and `animal-result.html` (Result).
    *   Mobile-optimized image preview (Square crop/contain).

## Current Plan

2.  **Fortune Logic Update:** Modify `horoscope.js` to generate dual results.
3.  **Result Pages:** 
    *   Update `horoscope-result.html` with image save logic.
    *   Create `animal-result.html`.
4.  **Deployment:** Deploy the final premium version.
