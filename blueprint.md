# 🔮 신비한 운세 & AI 테스트 - Blueprint (Trendy Responsive)

## Overview

A high-end, mobile-first responsive web application. It features a "Trendy & Sleek" UI with fluid layouts, glassmorphism, and smooth micro-interactions, providing a premium app-like experience on any device.

## Design Principles

*   **Mobile-First:** Core layout designed for mobile usability, expanding gracefully to desktop.
*   **App-like UI:** Sticky navigation, tactile buttons, and rounded corners (32px) for a modern look.
*   **Motion Design:** Subtle entry animations (Fade-in, Slide-up) and responsive hover states.
*   **Glassmorphism 2.0:** Layered semi-transparent backgrounds with refined blur effects and thin borders.

## Responsive Strategy (Current Plan)

1.  **Fluid Typography:** Scaling font sizes based on viewport width.
2.  **Adaptive Grids:**
    *   **Horoscope Page:** Side-by-side on desktop, stacked with logical order on mobile.
    *   **Lucky Items:** 3 columns on desktop, 2 or 1 column on smaller screens.
3.  **Touch Optimization:** Larger hit targets for mobile users and overflow-scrolling for long lists.

## Current Plan

1.  **CSS Overhaul:** Implement fluid responsiveness and modern motion effects in `style.css`.
2.  **Component Refinement:** Polish all cards, inputs, and badges for a consistent "premium" feel.
3.  **Animation Integration:** Add CSS-based entry animations to sections.
4.  **Deployment:** Push the trendy responsive version to GitHub.
